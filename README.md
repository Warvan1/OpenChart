# OpenChart
Openchart is a website for making and sharing flowcharts for free.

## Why did I create Openchart?
I needed to make some flowcharts and was using lucidchart and ran into there paywall after creating like 3 charts. This motivated me into making openchart as a free alternative to lucidcharts.

## Quick Start
Navigate to [openchart.online](https://openchart.online) and create an account. Once you have an account switch to the projects tab and create a project to get started. If you dont want to make an account you can use the guest account, **guest@openchart.online** with the password of **Guest1!!**

*(for the email field you can put anything as long as it looks like an email. There is no email confirmation.)*

## Usage
For Information about how to make flowcharts using this app check out the documentation page on the website. [openchart.online/docs](https://openchart.online/docs)

## How Its Made
To make openchart I used React for the frontend and Next.js for the backend and to control page navigation.
For user authentication I am using 0Auth a 3rd party secure service. 
For the database I am using MySQL.
I set up my own server using Linode cloud services, and set up an https NGINX web server on it.
