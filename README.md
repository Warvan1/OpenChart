OpenChart is a free tool for making flow charts.
To make this I used React for the frontend and Next.js for the backend and to control page navigation.
For user authentication I am using 0Auth a 3rd party secure service. 
For the database I am using MySQL.
I set up my own server using Linode cloud services, and set up an https NGINX web server on it.
